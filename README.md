If you want to browse through all the beers available in Brewdog's DIY Dog, you can easily do so using a dropdown menu. And of course, you can add every beer you like to a personal list.

# About this app

Hello everyone!  
I created this app as my final project for a TypeScript/SCSS/AJAX course. It was challenging, but it was a lot of fun to put my skills to the test with this project.  

The majority of the time we had (around 2 weeks), I was battling a cold and my code (and certainly my commits) reflected my condition at the time. But I believe I managed to salvage it in the end, and I am satisfied with my effort!
